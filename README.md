# Dashboard for visualizing 3-day weather forcast

The app uses data from Open Meteo (https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) Weather Forecast and Geocoding APIs. It was built with Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) to create meteograms for temperature, wind and precipitation data. Sunrise, sunset and current local time are also shown on the plots. The selected location has an info box and a map representation as well.
